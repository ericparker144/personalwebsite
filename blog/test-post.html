The Pre-Shower Water Heater is an award-winning water conservation system designed to drastically reduce annual freshwater consumption. The prototype design was awarded first prize in an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/index.html">IEEE</a> circuit design competition and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdQoW5Z1CvQ">promotional video</a> earned it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epicentreuwindsor.ca/epic-blue-sky-competition-2017-results/">first place in the 2017 EPIC Blue Sky Entrepreneurial Competition</a> hosted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epicentreuwindsor.ca/">EPICentre</a>.





The circuitâ€™s motivation came from the fact that most people run the water in their shower for a minute or so before stepping in to the shower to allow for the water to heat up to a comfortable temperature. This practice is extremely wasteful, and amounts to approximately 1.05 trillion liters of water wasted annually in the United States and Canada alone (see report for sources). Thus, this circuit eliminates that problem by introducing a way to provide people with water at a comfortable temperature immediately out of the shower or sink tap without any delay, allowing individuals to enter the shower or wash their hands comfortably the instant they turn the water on! It accomplishes this by storing most of the cold water remaining in the pipes running between your water heater and shower head (which is the cold water that needs to be flushed out before hot water flows through the shower head) in a heated basin, and allowing the user to heat up the water to any desired temperature with the turn of a dial. The user turns a dial and waits for the user interface to indicate that the water is heated, instead of running the water and waiting for it to get hot.

To learn more about the project, take a look at the full report by clicking on the button below. The report covers everything from the design process and market competitors to design details and prototype results. This project was completed with the help of a talented colleague Sean Santarossa. He is a fellow University of Windsor Electrical Engineering student and a good friend of mine.
